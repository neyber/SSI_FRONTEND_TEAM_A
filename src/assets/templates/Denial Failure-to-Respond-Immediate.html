					<p text-align='justify'>    The Department of Health Care Services (DHCS), Provider Enrollment Division (PED) notified you in a letter dated $SDM_Resolution.DateCreated of the discrepancies found during the initial review of your Medi-Cal Provider e-Form Application referenced above. You were given 60 calendar days to remediate these discrepancies and provide the requested information to DHCS. You did not respond within the allotted 60 day time period and as a result DHCS is denying your Medi-Cal Provider e-Form Application
Welfare & Institutions (W&I) Code Section 14043.26(h)(2)(A) states, "If the package that was noticed as incomplete under paragraph (2) of subdivision (f) is not resubmitted with all requested information and documentation and received by the Department within 60 days of the date on the notice, the application package shall be denied by operation of law. The applicant or provider may reapply by submitting a new application package that shall be reviewed de novo."
California Code of Regulations, Title 22, Section 51000.50(h) provides, in relevant part, "If a re-submitted application package for enrollment, continued enrollment, enrollment at a new additional or change in location, or enrollment pursuant to section 51000.30(b), is not received by the Department within 60 days of the date of the notice of an incomplete application pursuant to subsection (e)(2) above, the application package shall be denied by operation of law pursuant to Welfare and Institutions Code 14043.26. Nothing in this subsection prevents the provider from reapplying as a new applicant by submitting a new application package, which shall receive a new application received date."
You may re-apply for enrollment in the Medi-Cal program by submitting a complete application in the PAVE provider enrollment portal on the Medi Cal website once you have met all program requirements. </p>
